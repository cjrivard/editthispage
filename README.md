# editthispage

A modernized fork of the classic [editthispagephp](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/ephemera/editthispagephp-lightweight-experimental-wiki/) wiki/CMS, originally created by Alacrity Management Corp in 2003, now updated for today's PHP environments and web standards.

## Project Goals

- **Modern PHP Compatibility:** Update the codebase to work seamlessly with PHP 8+.
- **Bootstrap-Powered UI:** Replace legacy UI with a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing Bootstrap interface.
- **Markdown Editing:** Swap the original text formatting for Markdown, with live preview and secure rendering.
- **Improved Setup & Security:** Modernize the setup wizard, configuration, and security best practices.
- **Flat-File Simplicity:** Retain the original's database-free, file-based page storage model.
- **Easy Hosting:** Keep deployment and hosting as simple as possible.

For a detailed roadmap and planned features, see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).
